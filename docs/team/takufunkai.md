### Project: d'Intérieur

d'Intérieur is a desktop app for interior designers to manage their contacts and projects. The designer interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 26 kLoC.

Interior designers can use d'Intèrieur to improve contact management and take on the needs of an ever-growing client base, so that they can focus on what matters most - delivering quality service for clients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added favourites feature
  * What it does: allows the user to add, delete, and view images associated with each of their contacts.
  * Justification: Interior designers frequently work with images. Their clients' preferences, project designs and
    other details are often best represented through an image and not merely through words. Having these images
    can greatly improve their productivity, organization and help with attention to detail.

    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()

  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
